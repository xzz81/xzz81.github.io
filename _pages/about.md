I am **Chengyang Dong**, a Research Assistant working on **machine unlearning** in
**vision-language models (VLMs)**, **large language models (LLMs)**, and
**federated learning**.

My research focuses on enabling models to selectively forget specific knowledge or concepts
while preserving generalization, robustness, and multimodal alignment.
I am particularly interested in **class-level / concept-level unlearning**,
**continual learning**, and **data-efficient training** under non-IID and distributed settings.

I am currently preparing applications for **PhD programs in Computer Science / Artificial Intelligence**.
